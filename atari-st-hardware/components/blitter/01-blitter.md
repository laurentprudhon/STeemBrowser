# Blitter

> The BLiTTER (Bit Block Transfer Processor) is a custom chip in the STe and Mega STE that accelerates bitmap operations. The original ST does not have a dedicated blitter chip.

## Overview

The Atari ST **original** (ST, STe, MST) does not have a dedicated blitter chip - blitting was done in software by the CPU. The **Mega STE** introduced the **GST Shifter (C029145)** which contains a built-in blitter. The **Mega STE** is the only ST family model with hardware blitter support.

## GST Blitter (Mega STE only)

The Mega STE's GST Shifter (C029145) integrates the following:
- Shifter (video controller)
- **Blitter (BITBLT engine)**
- MMU functions
- Sound DMA controller

## Blitter Registers

The blitter has 11 registers mapped at `$FFE400-$FFE41F` (in the MMU address space):

| Register | Offset | Size | RW | Description |
|------|-|------|-|-|--|
| Blitter Control | $FFE400 | 16 bits | RW | Control/status register |
| Source Address | $FFE402 | 16 bits | RW | Source address (16-bit) |
| Source Byte | $FFE404 | 8 bits | RW | Source byte count low |
| Source Word Count | $FFE405 | 8 bits | RW | Source word count high |
| Destination Address | $FFE406 | 16 bits | RW | Destination address (16-bit) |
| Destination Byte | $FFE408 | 8 bits | RW | Dest byte count low |
| Dest Word Count | $FFE409 | 8 bits | RW | Dest word count high |
| Skew Register | $FFE40A | 16 bits | RW | Bit skew for source/dest |

### Blitter Control Register (Bit Map)

| Bit | Name | Description |
|----|--|---|
| 0 | S | Source bitplane (0 = 1 bitplane, 1 = 2 bitplanes) |
| 1 | D | Destination bitplanes (0 = mono, 1 = 2 bitplanes) |
| 2 | W | Word-aligned (0 = byte, 1 = word) |
| 3 | R | Repeat (0 = single, 1 = repeat) |
| 4 | H | Halftone (0 = normal, 1 = halftone mode) |
| 5 | M | Mask (0 = no mask, 1 = use mask) |
| 6 | B | Byte-swapped (0 = big-endian, 1 = little-endian) |
| 7 | L | Line (0 = single line, 1 = multi-line) |
| 8 | I | Input (0 = memory, 1 = I/O) |
| 9 | O | Output (0 = memory, 1 = I/O) |
| 10 | C | Copy (0 = logical, 1 = copy) |
| 11 | K | Invert (0 = normal, 1 = invert result) |
| 12 | T | Two-plane (0 = 1 bitplane, 1 = 2 bitplanes source) |
| 13 | 0 | Reserved |
| 14 | 0 | Reserved |
| 15 | BSY | Blitter busy (read-only, set while blitter is operating, cleared when done) |

### Logic Operations (Halftone mode)

When the Halftone bit (bit 4) is set, the blitter performs halftone/dither patterns:

| Skew value | Operation |
|------|-----|
| 0 | No skew |
| 1 | Skew right by 1 bit |
| 2 | Skew right by pattern bytes per line |
| 3 | Halftone dither with register as pattern |

## How to Use the Blitter

### Step-by-step Blit (Bit Block Transfer):

1. Write the control register (`$FFE400`) to configure the operation
2. Write source and destination addresses (`$FFE402`, `$FFE406`)
3. Write the source byte count (`$FFE404`)
4. Write the destination byte count (`$FFE408`)
5. Write the skew register (`$FFE40A`)
6. Write to the source address register again to **start** the transfer
7. Wait for the Busy bit (bit 15) of the control register to clear
8. Read and clear the interrupt pending register

### Timing

- The blitter operates at system clock speed
- One blitter cycle transfers one bit per clock (1 bit at 16 MHz)
- Block transfer speed depends on the width and number of planes
