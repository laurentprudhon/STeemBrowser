DOMAIN: Emu
FILE: data_union.h
DESCRIPTION: Those smart unions allow direct assignment of part of the data,
as opposed to masking and shifting.
Not sure it's recommended by the standard but we're doing low-level stuff.
For instance, d8[1] is the high byte of d16 (little endian systems)
you do: 

var.d8[1]=my_byte;

instead of: 

var&=0x00FF; 
var|=(my_byte)<<8;

You can also use C++ references this way:

BYTE &varh=var.d8[1];
BYTE &varl=var.d8[0];

Then:

varh=my_byte;

In Steem SSE we also define LO (low order) and HI (high order) 
for potential portability.
