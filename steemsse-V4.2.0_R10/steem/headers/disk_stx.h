DOMAIN: Disk image
FILE: disk_stx.h
CONDITION: SSE_DISK_STX must be defined
DESCRIPTION: Declarations for native STX disk image support
Native suport is necessary because we don't think there will be a Pasti
plugin for Linux, and for the moment there's no Windows 64bit plugin either.
This is based on the unofficial Pasti file format documentation by DrCoolZic
and especially sarnau (see 3rdparty/doc).
